#### 👀 Where you can look for answer
Whenever there is a problem to solve and you (or we!) don't know how to solve it, we have a great resource. <br><br>
It's called <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.<br><br>
There is no shame in not knowing something – just be smart when you learn:<br>
don't copy/paste the solution, **type it yourself** 😉

#### ✅ How to install a Code Editor

You can write `HTML` & `CSS` even in Word or a simpel Text Editor but a Code Editor gives you lots of help.
<br> **Visual Studio Code** is a great one. Plus, it's free ⭐️

Let's download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>

`VS Code` is really easy and intuitive to use.<br>
It allows you to create _folders_ and _files_.<br><br>
If you have questions, you can always search the web or go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
